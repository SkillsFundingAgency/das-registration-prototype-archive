        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m" id="1" style="position: -webkit-sticky; position: sticky; top: -1px; background-color:#fff"><span class="number">1.</span>Introduction</h2>
        <h3 style="z-index:1">1.1</h3>
        <p>The EOI is trialling a new way to engage training providers, for employers that do not pay the apprenticeship levy. It puts the employer firmly in control. You have been selected by us (“the ESFA”) to participate in the EOI project (“EOI”). This will help us to test and shape a service that will eventually be rolled out for thousands of employers. We will refer to you in this Memorandum of Understanding as an “EOI Employer”.</p>
        
        <h3>1.2</h3>
        <p data-point="1.2">In order to ensure that the EOI goes smoothly, the ESFA has a number of requirements of EOI Employers. The purpose of this Memorandum of Understanding is to set them out and for you as an EOI employer to agree to comply with them.</p>
        <h3>1.3</h3>
        <p>This Memorandum of Understanding is not a contract but the expectation of the ESFA is that the EOI Employer will comply with its terms.</p>
        <h3>1.4</h3>
        <p>This Memorandum of Understanding begins on 12 August 2019 or the date of the Employer's electronic acceptance of these terms and conditions on www.gov.uk (whichever is later) and ends on 31 December 2019 unless the ESFA communicates an extension to the EOI Employer in writing.</p>
        <!-- <h3>1.5</h3>
        <p>A reference to a person or body includes a reference to its successor.</p> -->
        
        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m" id="2" style="position: -webkit-sticky; position: sticky; top: -1px; background-color:#fff"><span class="number">2.</span>Registration</h2>
        <h3>2.1</h3>
        <p>To participate in the EOI, the EOI Employer must register for an account on the Apprenticeship Service (“Apprenticeship Service Account”).</p>
    
        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m" id="3" style="position: -webkit-sticky; position: sticky; top: -1px; background-color:#fff"><span class="number">3.</span>Reserveation</h2>
        <h3>3.1</h3>
        <p>The EOI Employer must create a reservation of funds for the apprenticeship. The reservation must be created before apprentice details are added in the Apprenticeship Service Account.  </p>
        <h3>3.2</h3>
        <p>Once registered, an EOI Employer can authorise the training provider to create a reservation of funds on their behalf using the provider permissions functionality within their Apprenticeship Service Account. The EOI Employer will receive a notification each time the training provider takes action on behalf of the EOI Employer. </p>
        <h3>3.3</h3>
        <p>An EOI employer can revoke provider permissions  at any time.</p>
        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m" id="4" style="position: -webkit-sticky; position: sticky; top: -1px; background-color:#fff"><span class="number">4. </span>Recruitment</h2>
        <h3>4.1</h3>
        <p>Training providers and EOI Employers can both undertake apprenticeship recruitment through the Apprenticeship Service Account.</p>
        <h3>4.2</h3>
        <p>If an EOI Employer so chooses, it can give the training provider permission to use the Recruit an Apprentice feature on its behalf.</p>
        <h3>4.3</h3>
        <p>The EOI Employer will receive a notification each time the training provider takes action on behalf of the EOI Employer. The permissions can be revoked at any time and therefore the EOI Employer remains in control.</p>
        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m" id="5" style="position: -webkit-sticky; position: sticky; top: -1px; background-color:#fff"><span class="number">5.</span>Payments, Approvals and Commitments</h2>
        <h3>5.1</h3>
        <p>The EOI Employer and training provider must agree the details of the apprenticeship, including the cost, before it starts and this information must be recorded on the Apprenticeship Service Account. </p>
        <h3>5.2</h3>
        <p>The EOI Employer must approve the apprenticeship details. If the details are not approved, the ESFA will not release funds to the training provider and they will not be paid.</p>
        <h3>5.3</h3>
        <p>The EOI Employer must only approve apprenticeship details for the training provider(s) and the number of apprentices detailed in their EOI application, unless it has had written approval from the ESFA.</p>
        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m" id="6" style="position: -webkit-sticky; position: sticky; top: -1px; background-color:#fff"><span class="number">6. </span>Requirements</h2>
        <h3>6.1</h3>
        <p>An EOI Employer must:</p>
         <ol>
          <h3>6.1.1</h3>
          <p>Ensure that it has the appropriate registrations with the Information Commission for controlling and / or processing data (as appropriate) and that it maintains them.</p>
          <h3>6.1.2</h3>
          <p>Ensure that the information about an apprenticeship is entered accurately on the Apprenticeship Service Account and that it is kept up to date.</p>
          <h3>6.1.3</h3>
          <p>Promptly review and, if it is correct, approve details (including cost) about an apprenticeship entered on the Apprenticeship Service Account by a training provider.</p>
          <h3>6.1.4</h3>
          <p>Inform the ESFA of any concerns that the EOI Employer might have about the training provision or the apprentice.</p>
          <h3>6.1.5</h3>
          <p>Inform the ESFA if its liabilities exceed its assets and it enters into any arrangements whatsoever with creditors or court action is taken against it to enforce the payment of the EOI Employer’s debts.</p>
          <h3>6.1.6</h3>
          <p>Ensure that it only creates reserves funds and approves apprenticeship details for the same training provider it agreed to work with when submitting the EOI application.</p>
          <h3>6.1.7</h3>
          <p>Ensure that it does not exceed the number of new Apprenticeships started through EOI set out in its EOI application.</p>
          <h3>6.1.8</h3>
          <p>Ensure that information on its Apprenticeship Service Account is up to date, making and/or approving amendments when changes are required.</p>
        </ol>
        <h3>6.2</h3>
        <p>A failure by the EOI Employer to comply with the obligations set out in paragraph 7.1 and any other obligations notified by the ESFA to the EOI Employer in writing will lead to the ESFA taking action. Where the breach has been material, this will lead to the EOI Employer being removed from EOI.</p>
        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m" id="7" style="position: -webkit-sticky; position: sticky; top: -1px; background-color:#fff"><span class="number">7. </span>Disclaimer</h2>
        <h3>7.1</h3>
        <p>The EOI Employer takes part in the EOI entirely at its own cost and risk. The ESFA is not liable at all to the EOI Employer for any costs, expenses, claims, loss of business or any other loss that might arise through participation in the EOI.</p>
